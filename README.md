# React-Google-Book-Search

Here is my React Google Book Search. When you type a book in the search bar it will come up with books with that title. You can sort the books from newest to oldest. The one thing I had trouble with is that when you save the book it will save the whole search instead of the single book. I couldn't figure out what the problem was.
